# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

An old project I took part in.

Data was parsed from https://hitbtc.com/.

There are two datasets. File dataset.csv contains raw data from the website. File dataset_for_lstm.csv contains preprocessed data from the same website.

The first way was to use Deep Learning methods to predict the price.
Another was to use SMA to round microchanges in the price and to do classification task rather then regression.

Unfortunately the project was abandoned before that.
